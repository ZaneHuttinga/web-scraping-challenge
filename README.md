Data Visualization and Analytics Boot Camp Challenge 11

## MarsNews

### Part 1

The Jupyter Notebook file 'part_1_mars_news.ipynb' contains Python code to scrape the webpage at the address https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html. This page contains a list of news stories about Mars, and the code scrapes the headline and preview description of each.

### Part 2

The Jupyter Notebook file 'part_2_mars_weather.ipynb' contains Python code that scrapes the Mars weather data at the address https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. It then uses this data to answer several questions about the trends in Mars' weather over time, and exports the data to the file 'mars_weather.csv'.

### Notes

The method for answering questions 1 and 2 in Part 2 (the numbers of months and days in the data set) comes from Method 3 at this webpage: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-count-unique-values-inside-a-list/
